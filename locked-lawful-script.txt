Congress just did something that hasn't happened in 90 years: they permanently eliminated the $200 tax on suppressors and short-barreled rifles.

Not reduced. Not suspended. Permanently prohibited any federal agency from collecting it.

But within 72 hours, Senator Chris Murphy introduced a bill to bring it back — at $5,500 per stamp.

Here's what's actually happening, what it means for you, and why the next few weeks matter more than the last nine decades.

If you own NFA items or you've been waiting on the sidelines because of that $200 barrier, subscribe now. This situation is moving fast in Congress and in the courts, and I'm tracking all of it.

Let's start with what actually passed.

This legislation doesn't just cut the tax — it creates a statutory prohibition. That means no executive order, no ATF regulation, and no future budget maneuver can bring it back without brand new legislation passing both chambers and getting a presidential signature.

The numbers: 218 representatives. 52 senators. States representing over 190 million Americans.

And here's the part that matters if you've got a Form 4 sitting in limbo: the effective date was immediate. The moment the president signed it, every pending suppressor application that hadn't been processed became tax-free. The ATF is reportedly sitting on around 43,000 pending applications — and those applicants are entitled to refunds.

That $200 tax has generated over $340 million since 2000. That revenue stream just got permanently cut off.

So what happens to the agency that was built to process it?

According to FOIA documents, the ATF's NFA division has seen processing times drop dramatically — from an average of 240 days down to roughly 14 days on new applications. Without a tax to verify and process, the justification for those long wait times evaporates.

The ATF reportedly employs around 287 people whose primary function is processing NFA stamps. Congress allocated $34 million this fiscal year specifically for that work. Now that money has no legal purpose, and federal agencies can't just redirect funds without approval.

Here's where it gets interesting: there are reports the ATF is exploring whether they can impose administrative processing fees to replace the eliminated tax — essentially charging for background checks and registry maintenance.

Whether that's legally viable is another question. But it tells you they're not planning to let this infrastructure disappear quietly.

Now let's talk about the courts, because this might be where the real action happens.

Fifteen state attorneys general — Texas, Florida, Montana, Wyoming, and eleven others — have joined with Gun Owners of America, the Firearms Regulatory Accountability Coalition, and Silencer Shop in what's become the largest coordinated challenge to the NFA in history.

These states represent over 125 million Americans and account for roughly 61% of all suppressor ownership in the country.

Their argument is elegant: the Supreme Court upheld the NFA in 1939 specifically because it was a revenue measure under Congress's taxing power. Remove the tax permanently? You remove the constitutional foundation.

The plaintiffs filed for summary judgment — meaning they're not asking for a trial. They're saying the legal question is so clear that a judge should rule immediately.

Three federal judges in three circuits are currently considering motions that could strike down NFA registration requirements entirely. All three have issued preliminary orders allowing expedited review, which is rare in Second Amendment cases.

One judge — Reed O'Connor in the Northern District of Texas — wrote that "continued enforcement of a regulatory scheme" after Congress eliminates its tax basis "may constitute an ongoing constitutional violation."

That's not a ruling. But it's a signal.

If O'Connor grants a preliminary injunction, it could block ATF enforcement of NFA registration in Texas immediately — and nationwide shortly after.

Which brings us to Senator Murphy's response.

His amendment proposes raising the NFA transfer tax from $0 to $5,500. Manufacturing tax: also $5,500. And a new $750 annual registration fee for items already in the registry.

Let's do the math.

The original 1934 tax was $200. Adjusted for inflation, that's about $4,600 today. Murphy's proposal exceeds that. It would be the highest tax burden on a constitutional right in American history.

But the annual fee is the real kicker. There are approximately 5.2 million registered NFA items in civilian hands. At $750 per year, that's $3.9 billion annually — extracted exclusively from gun owners.

And according to analysis of the amendment text, this tax would apply retroactively to items already in the registry, with payment due within 180 days or the item must be surrendered for destruction.

If you bought a suppressor five years ago for $800 plus the $200 stamp, you'd owe $5,500 within six months — or hand it over.

The average NFA owner has 2.3 registered items. That's a $12,650 bill, on six months' notice, for things you already legally own.

Murphy introduced this during the appropriations process — the same mechanism used to eliminate the tax. The deadline is March 28th, 2026, or the government shuts down. He's betting that shutdown pressure will force enough Republicans to vote yes on a package with his amendment buried inside.

So where does this leave us?

Three possible outcomes:

One: The courts rule first. If a federal judge strikes down NFA registration requirements before Congress acts, Murphy's amendment becomes irrelevant. You can't tax a registry that no longer exists.

Two: Murphy's amendment passes in the appropriations package. That means $5,500 stamps, annual fees, and retroactive bills for current owners.

Three: The amendment fails, the tax stays at zero, and we wait to see how the ATF adapts.

The DOJ has already spent over $8 million defending the NFA in these 15 lawsuits. They've filed emergency motions asking judges to delay rulings until after the appropriations process concludes. They're explicitly asking the courts to wait and see if Congress changes the law first.

That's an admission. They know they're vulnerable on the current facts.

This is the most significant movement on NFA reform since 1934. What happens in federal courts and in Congress over the next eight weeks will determine whether this victory holds or gets buried in a shutdown fight.
