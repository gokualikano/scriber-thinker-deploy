# 2026-01-29 Session Notes

## Late Night Session (4:15 AM - 6:45 AM)

### Mac Access Setup
- Tried setting up full Mac access via Clawdbot nodes
- Accessibility enabled ✅
- AppleScript enabled ✅
- Command execution still has security=deny on one node
- Browser extension node needs approval prompts

### Business Ideas Discussed
1. Contractor vetting platform (escrow model) - needs $300-500 to start
2. AI automation agency - $0 to start, sell YouTube scripts
3. UGC/viral clip licensing broker - $0 to start
4. **Winner: YouTube Channel Monetization Service**

### YouTube Monetization Service Model
- Malik's offer: $5K investment, 4 months to monetize
- If success: 30% equity + $300/mo management
- If fail: 70% refund + client keeps channel
- Proof: 5 channels monetized (21, 45, 63, 70 days)
- 2-3 videos/day, not AI slop
