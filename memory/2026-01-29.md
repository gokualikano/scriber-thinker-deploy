# 2026-01-29 Session Notes

## Late Night Session (4:15 AM - 7:00 AM)

### Mac Access Setup
- Tried setting up full Mac access via Clawdbot nodes
- Accessibility enabled ✅
- AppleScript enabled ✅
- Command execution still has security=deny on one node
- Browser extension node needs approval prompts

### Business Ideas Discussed
1. Contractor vetting platform (escrow model) - needs $300-500 to start
2. AI automation agency - $0 to start, sell YouTube scripts
3. UGC/viral clip licensing broker - $0 to start
4. **Winner: YouTube Channel Monetization Service**

### YouTube Monetization Service Model
- Malik's offer: $5K investment, 4 months to monetize
- If success: 30% equity + $300/mo management
- If fail: 70% refund + client keeps channel
- Proof: 5 channels monetized (21, 45, 63, 70 days)
- 2-3 videos/day, not AI slop
- Malik chooses niche, not AI slop that gets terminated

## Afternoon Session (5:44 PM onwards)

### "Thinker" - Thumbnail Generator Workflow Built
**For:** H1 and H3 channels (disaster content)

**Input:** YouTube link (competitor video)

**Output:**
1. 🎨 **ImageFX Prompt** (Malik's style)
2. 📝 **5 Titles** (80-100 characters each)
3. 🔥 **5 Thumbnail Captions** (3-5 words each)

### ImageFX Prompt Style (CRITICAL)
- Analyze competitor thumbnail first
- Similar scene but **DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE** each time
- Rotate angles: ground level from car, aerial/drone, dashcam, overpass looking down, roadside POV, behind crowd watching, through building window, emergency responder angle, etc.
- **MORE chaos/destruction** than original:
  - Ice storm → more crashed trucks, black ice, chain reaction pileups
  - Floods → huge waves crashing into buildings, cars floating, towers falling
  - Volcano → more lava erupting and flowing, destroying structures
  - Earthquake → collapsed buildings, rubble, cracks in ground
- **Mobile phone quality** (rough, grainy, NOT polished 4K)
- **NO text** in the image
- Through dirty/cracked window feel, realistic raw footage vibe

### Script Built
- `~/clawd/scripts/extract_transcript.py` - extracts YouTube transcripts via yt-dlp
- Handles auto-generated and manual captions
- Outputs clean JSON with title, duration, word count, transcript text

### Test Run
- Video: Louisiana Ice Storm I-20 (15 min video)
- Transcript: 823 words extracted successfully
- Generated ImageFX prompt, 5 titles (80-100 chars), 5 captions (3-5 words)

### Scriber Built (8:00 PM)
- YouTube SEO Optimizer tool
- Location: `~/clawd/scriber/`
- Features: Transcript + description + tags → SEO description, disclaimer, optimized tags

- Auto-restart on crash, start on login
- URLs change on Mac restart
