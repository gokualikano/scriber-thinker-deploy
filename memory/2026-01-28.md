## YouTube Automation System - Script Style Optimization

### User Provided Reference Style Example
User shared their desired script style - a 1800+ word narrative about Russian snow disaster with:
- Very long paragraphs (200+ words each)
- Dramatic opening: "Two people are dead, thousands are trapped..."
- Direct narrative storytelling (no quotes/interviews)
- Comprehensive scene-setting and chronological development
- Mandatory ending: "That's it for today folks, see you in the next video."

### Script Generator Improvements Made
✅ Updated script_generator.py to match user's style:
- Removed all quotes/interviews, pure direct narrative
- Added mandatory ending phrase requirement
- Improved dramatic opening patterns
- Enhanced channel-specific tone instructions (H1, H2, H3)
- Increased detail level and comprehensive storytelling

### Current Status
✅ Script style changes implemented in ~/clawdbot_system/script_generator.py
✅ Tests confirm correct ending phrase is added
✅ No more quotes or interviews in generated scripts
⚠️ Still working on achieving 200+ word paragraph lengths (currently ~60-80 words)

### Technical Infrastructure Ready
✅ Complete system in ~/clawdbot_system/:
- video_orchestrator.py (main pipeline controller)
- script_generator.py (improved narrative style)
- transcript_extractor.py, trello_handler.py, google_drive_handler.py
- All API keys configured in config.json
- Full automation pipeline ready for testing

### Next Steps
1. Fine-tune paragraph length generation
2. Test full pipeline with user's preferred style
3. Build thumbnail generation system
4. Complete the 36 videos/week automation goal
